## 🧠 Baekjoon Step-by-Step Progress for **Republic of Korea Air Force Hackathon**

I systematically completed Baekjoon’s structured step-by-step problem-solving curriculum using Python (and a few problems in Java).
From the most basic input/output exercises to algorithmic challenges like brute-force search and recursion,  
each stage strengthened my foundation in algorithmic thinking and computational efficiency.

### ✅ Completed Stages

**1. Input and Arithmetic Operations** — Practiced basic input/output and arithmetic operations (13 problems)  
**2. Conditional Statements** — Learned how to control program flow using `if`, `else`, and `elif` (7 problems)  
**3. Loops** — Practiced iterative logic using `for` and `while` loops (12 problems)  
**4. One-Dimensional Arrays** — Managed multiple data items using **arrays**, performing summations and statistics (10 problems)  
**5. Strings** — Learned string manipulation, indexing, and **ASCII (character code)** conversion (11 problems)  
**6. Advanced 1** — Combined syntax and logic from earlier stages to solve intermediate problems (8 problems)  
**7. Two-Dimensional Arrays** — Solved problems using **arrays or nested lists** in matrix form (4 problems)  
**8. Mathematics 1** — Strengthened mathematical thinking through remainder, divisor, and multiple calculations (7 problems)  
**9. Divisors, Multiples, and Primes 1** — Studied number theory fundamentals such as prime identification (6 problems)  
**10. Geometry 1** — Approached geometric problems involving triangles and rectangles (8 problems)  
**11. Time Complexity** — Learned how to analyze and predict algorithmic efficiency (7 problems)  
**12. Brute Force** — Practiced exhaustive search by checking all possible cases (6 problems)

Through these stages, I developed a deep understanding of how **time complexity, data structure choice, and mathematical reasoning** impact algorithmic design.
